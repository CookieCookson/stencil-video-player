00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.860
What's he doing?

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:10.020
He's making
the wrong face!

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.500
Look who just
sent me a text!

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.880
Maddy McAlister??

5
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.060
What should I say?

6
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.920
Just play it cool.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.380
Welcome to the world
inside your phone

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.680
where everyone is expected to act
one way their whole life.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.000
Aww... snap!

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.660
Ow.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.480
My name is Gene

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.240
and I'm supposed to
be a "meh".

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.880
Mehh.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.520
You know, like "meh,
who cares?"

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.020
My problem is
I have more than one emotion.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.960
Check this out!

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.560
Huh, huh?

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.680
Ha ha ha!

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.780
Son, please tell me

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.340
you weren't laughing just now.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.840
What if you get sent out
on the phone

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.660
making the wrong face?

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.240
Dad, I'll make the right face

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.840
then I'll finally fit in.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.220
Meh.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.060
Sweetie, you're so handsome
when you make that face.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.660
I think he's ready, Mel.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.620
Meh.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.180
That's our user, Alex.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.140
We have an incoming text!

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.000
We are go for meh!

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.800
Who, me?

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.880
What's he doing?

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.160
He's making
the wrong face!

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.260
Huh, what the heck?

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.280
Welcome to the loser
lounge where the Emojis

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.380
who never get used hang out.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.220
Wassup, Hi Five?

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.180
I'm an Emoji.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.160
I gotta have some
sort of purpose here.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.040
I'm gonna help you.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.740
We need to get off the phone
and find the source code.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.780
Then I can fit in!

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.540
Let's roll!

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.360
Bye, Felicia.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.000
First we have to
get through this-

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.400
Firewall.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.360
What's Alex's
girlfriend's name again?

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.400
It was...

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.880
Tina.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.280
Access denied.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.540
Karen

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.860
Sarah

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.200
I want to say Lupita,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.700
but that doesn't feel right now
that I'm saying out loud.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.060
I think you're pretty cool
just the way you are.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.140
Wow!

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.140
Nobody leaves the phone!

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.660
Delete them!

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.300
My feelings are huge.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.540
Maybe I'm meant to
have more than just one emotion.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.760
Where am I??

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.320
Candy Crush!

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.380
Divine! Sweet!

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.780
Tasty! Delicious!

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.600
Urrgh, I'm never eating
another piece of candy EVER again.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.120
High Five, don't do it.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.460
Don't you do it.
It's already been in there once.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.380
Ugh.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.040
[toilet flush]

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.960
Okay, son. What do we do
after we go potty?

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.620
Should we wash our hands?

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.300
Ha ha ha!

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.320
We're number two!
